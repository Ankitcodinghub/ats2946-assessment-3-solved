Question 1: Argument analysis: complex arguments

Put the argument from the following passage into standard form and construct an argument map diagram, observing the following points:

Make sure each premise and conclusion is written out as a complete sentence.

Make sure that all premises and conclusions are clearly labelled.

Represent the structure of the argument in the argument map diagram, distinguishing clearly between co-dependent and independent premises. Make sure to properly represent any sub-arguments on both your diagram and standard form.

Do not include any statements that are not required by the argument, even if they can be found somewhere in the passage.

You can insert your argument map diagram into the box below, or attach it as a file. Word document, RTF, PDF, JPG are all acceptable formats.

Correct conclusion 5/5 Excellent!

All premises correct 4/5 Correct. But premises should be complete statements e.g.

not just saying “these policies”.

Sub-argument(s) correctly identified 4/5 Almost perfect! But premise 1 is independent, not a support for premise 3.

Diagram 5/5 The map correctly represents the argument as written in the standard form.

Question 2: Argument evaluation

The following argument has been standardised and an argument map diagram provided. Write a short evaluation of the argument

(150-200 words).

If you think the argument provides a compelling reason for thinking that the conclusion is true (the argument is successful), consider what parts of the argument are weakest (1-3). Explain why someone might take these weaknesses to undermine the argument and why you think they are mistaken.

If you think the argument does not provide a compelling reason for thinking that the conclusion is true (the argument is unsuccessful), discuss its main problems (1-3). Explain why they undermine the argument. If additional information could save the argument say what this is. If the argument is fatally flawed, explain why.

You might consider potential issues around support (in the broad sense) and the truth of premises. However, in this assessment, we are concerned only with the main/major/most significant problems or potential issues – so try to prioritise those in your answer.

You might find it helpful to use the following as a template for your evaluation:

Paragraph 1:

First sentence: say what the conclusion of the argument is and whether the argument provides a good reason for accepting it. Second sentence: say how many major problems/weaknesses you are going to discuss.

Body paragraphs [repeat for each issue that you discuss]:

First sentence: say what the problem/weakness is.

Next sentence(s): explain why it is a problem/weakness for the argument.

Final sentence(s): say what would need to be established for the argument to be successful / Explain how, with minor adjustments,

the problem can be overcome.

The argument

I believe that the most effective response to the ethical risks surrounding emerging technologies is to rely on big tech companies to deal with those risks themselves, without outside influence and regulation. Big tech companies have plenty of money and resources to dedicate to dealing with these ethical risks. They also have the most knowledge about the technical details of emerging technologies.

So, big tech companies are clearly capable of dealing with the ethical risks surrounding emerging technologies themselves.

Standard form &amp; argument map

P1. Big tech companies have plenty of money and resources to dedicate to dealing with the ethical risks surrounding emerging technologies.

P2. Big tech companies have the most knowledge about the technical details of emerging technologies.

Therefore,

P3. Big tech companies are capable of dealing with the ethical risks surrounding emerging technologies themselves.

Therefore,

C. The most effective response to the ethical risks surrounding emerging technologies is to rely on big tech companies to deal with those risks themselves, without outside influence and regulation.

The argument is unsuccessful in providing good reasons for thinking that large technology companies are the most effective in addressing the ethical risks of emerging technologies without influence and regulation. There are three major problems with the argument, and I will discuss them below.

To strengthen this argument, more evidence is needed to support the assumption that large tech companies have the capability and willingness to address ethical risks. This could include evidence of the ethical decision-making processes within tech companies, transparency in decision-making, and consideration of potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, the argument should acknowledge the need for interdisciplinary expertise in addressing the ethical implications of new technologies, rather than only relying on the technical knowledge of large tech companies.

Mark Comments

Identification of problems / potential issues 6/8 Three problems are

identified: 1: capability is not sufficient to produce willingness; 2: the truth status of the knowledge not firm; 3: the assumption that lack of interference will lead to better ethical outcomes is counterintuitive.

Good, but you missed: technological knowledge does not equate to ethical knowledge: i.e., maybe they do not have the capacity at all.

Discussion of problems / potential issues 8/8 Good justifications supplied for the problems selected.

Clarity of writing 4/4 Very clear writing.
